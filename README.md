# Ising-Deep-Learning
In this repo I explore various deep learning algorithms as applied to the 2-dimensional Ising model.

First, I generate a dataset of Ising model configurations by performing Monte Carlo simulations at various temperatures.
These simulations are performed in ```Ising_genData.ipynb```.
